- **'critical/other existing credit'**: Cluster 0 has 5 cases falling into this category. It suggests that 5 applicants have a credit history described as 'critical/other existing credit.'
- **'delayed previously'**: There are 7 cases where applicants in Cluster 0 have a history of 'delayed previously,' suggesting a history of late payments or delays.
- **'existing paid'**: The majority of applicants in Cluster 0 (76 cases) have an 'existing paid' credit history, indicating a record of successfully repaid credit.
- **'no credits/all paid'**: There are 4 instances where applicants in Cluster 0 either have no previous credit history or have a history of 'all paid.'

**Cluster 1**:
- **'all paid'**: Cluster 1 contains 12 cases with a credit history of 'all paid,' indicating successful credit repayment.
- **'critical/other existing credit'**: This cluster includes 24 applicants with a history categorized as 'critical/other existing credit.'
- **'delayed previously'**: In Cluster 1, 17 cases have a history of 'delayed previously,' suggesting past late payments.
- **'existing paid'**: The majority of applicants in Cluster 1 (33 cases) have an 'existing paid' credit history, indicating successful repayment.
- **'no credits/all paid'**: There are 14 instances in Cluster 1 where applicants either have no prior credit history or have a history of 'all paid.'

**Cluster 2**:
- **'all paid'**: Cluster 2 has only 1 case with a 'all paid' credit history.
- **'critical/other existing credit'**: The majority of applicants in Cluster 2 (71 cases) have a history categorized as 'critical/other existing credit,' indicating a substantial presence of this credit history type.
- **'delayed previously'**: There are 9 cases in Cluster 2 with a history of 'delayed previously.'
- **'existing paid'**: 16 cases in Cluster 2 have an 'existing paid' credit history, suggesting successful credit repayment.
